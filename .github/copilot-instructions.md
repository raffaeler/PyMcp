Rules for this repository:
- use Python 3.11 or higher
- use the `uv` package manager
- try reusing the dependencies already in `pyproject.toml` before adding new ones
- always create code using typing hints and try to avoid `Any` at all
- write docstrings for all functions
- get rid of the warnings
